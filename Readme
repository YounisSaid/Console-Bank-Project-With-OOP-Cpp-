## 📖 Introduction
This project is a **console-based banking system** that simulates basic banking operations such as:
- Account creation
- Deposits & withdrawals
- Balance inquiries

The project follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** for better modularity, scalability, and maintainability.  
It is built using **pure C++** and **stores data in text files** (`Clients.txt` and `Users.txt`) as a simple Database Management System (**DMS**).  

Additionally, it supports **multiple currencies**, allowing users to manage accounts and perform transactions in different currencies.

> 🎯 **This project is ideal for learning and practicing OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.**
